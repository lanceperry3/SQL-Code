/*
You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of 
those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are 
entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students 
by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades 
in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular 
students by their marks in ascending order.
